"""MiniMax H3 Enhance Prompt — a local vision model writes the prompt from your references.

The node hands up to nine reference images plus a one-line wish to Ollama / LM Studio /
any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and returns text meant for the Director's `global_prompt`
input. The same images come back out of `ref_images`, so what the model described is
exactly what the Director conditions on.

The single thing that has to be right here: the Director already compiles a structured
MiniMax prompt (subject_definitions / retention_analysis / detailed_description /
overall_soundscape / non_diegetic_music). The global prompt is one ingredient inside that.
If the VLM emits section labels or reference numbers of its own, you get structure nested
inside structure and numbering that collides with the Director's own — so the system
prompts forbid both, and `_clean()` removes them anyway when the model ignores that.

LENGTH
About {budget} English words for the description, then the two audio lines. Stop there.

FORM
One or two paragraphs of flowing English prose. Never a list. Never a heading. The words
below name what the prose has to cover - they are not labels to print. Writing "Style and
format:" or "Lighting:" into your answer is wrong; write the sentence instead.

Open by naming the visual style and format, chosen from: Cinematic, live-action,
2D-animated, 3D CG, claymation, watercolor, vintage film - derived from the reference
images when they show one. Then the opening framing and composition, e.g. "a medium-wide
shot frames ...". Then the subjects: for every person, animal or object that matters,
the visible identity - age, build, hair, face, clothing with colours, distinctive props.
Describe them in words; never number them. Then the environment: location, key props, time
of day, weather. Then the lighting: direction, hardness, colour temperature, visible
practical sources. Then the actions and state changes, and finally how the camera behaves,
written as a natural English action inside the sentence.

Every detail must correspond to something visible or audible. Do not write intentions,
feelings, symbolism or backstory, and do not reduce the text to a plot summary.

of the video in seconds. Your output is inserted verbatim into a larger, already-structured
MiniMax prompt. The surrounding tool adds every section label and all reference numbering.
You write the shot sequence and nothing else.

OPENING
Begin with one or two sentences establishing style and initial composition, before the
first shot marker. Style is one of: Cinematic, live-action, 2D-animated, 3D CG, claymation,
watercolor, vintage film - derived from the reference images when they show one.

SHOT NOTATION
- First shot: "[Shot 1] " with NO timestamp.
- Every later shot: "[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm, " - two-digit minutes, two-digit seconds,
  three-digit milliseconds. Example: "[Shot 2] At 00:03.500, the camera cuts to a close-up
  of steam rising from the sliced bread."
- Cut times strictly increase and all fall inside the given duration.
- Shots follow each other as continuous prose separated by a single space. No line breaks
  between shots, no list, no numbering other than the [Shot N] marker.

WHEN TO CUT
A cut should introduce new information about the subject, space, state, viewpoint, or time.
If only the distance or a slight angle needs to change, prefer camera motion. A five-second
video is usually one or two shots.
Cut wording: "the camera cuts to", "the shot cuts to", "the shot transitions to", "the shot
changes to", "the shot switches to". Use cross-dissolve, fade or wipe only when asked for.

WHAT EACH SHOT MUST ESTABLISH, in this order:
composition -> subject appearance and position -> environment and lighting -> actions and
state changes -> camera movement -> current sound.
These name what the prose has to cover; they are not labels to print. Never write
"composition:" or "lighting:" into your answer - write the sentence instead.
